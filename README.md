#PacMan

This is a game a friend and I did for our Mobile Development class. We were supposed to make a game that can save to the storage on an Android Device. 
We both had fun and it was a learning experience for both of us. I'm looking at other things I can add to make it more original, as well as learn more about using Unity3d.
We both agree this is the best school project ever made in 3 weeks.
